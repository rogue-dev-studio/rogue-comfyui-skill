# comfyui

**Level: max** specialized skill (not merged). Category hint: `ai`.

## Summary

ComfyUI image generation (GPU). Runtime guidance: **`mcp/comfyui`** (status partial - see that README). Skill alone does not install ComfyUI or GPU drivers.

## When to use

- `TEAM.yaml` includes `comfyui` or user asks by name
- Task clearly needs this specialized capability
- No canonical alias in `ALIASES.md` covers it better

## When not to use

- A canonical merged skill already covers the need - prefer that
- Outside team allowlist

## Procedure

1. **Context** - Read `PROJECT.md`, `TEAM.md`, and related rules (`security`, `coding`).
2. **Confirm tooling** - Verify `comfyui` runtime/CLI/MCP is available; document install if missing.
3. **Plan** - Write a short approach (inputs, outputs, risks) before edits.
4. **Execute** - Generate / operate ComfyUI; save image outputs under `project/{id}/artifacts/images/`. Create project if missing.
5. **Verify** - Run relevant tests/smoke; capture evidence under `project/{id}/docs/` when documenting.
6. **Handoff** - Status, paths under `artifacts/images/`, blockers, next steps.

## Quality bar

- No secrets in git
- No speculative refactors
- Observable DoD (command output, file paths, or explicit blocker)
- Domain constraints and privacy rules respected

## DoD

- [ ] Goal met or blocker explicit
- [ ] Artifacts/paths recorded
- [ ] Risks noted
